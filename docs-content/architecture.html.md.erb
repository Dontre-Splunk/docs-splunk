## <a id='architecture'></a> Architecture Overview

The Splunk Firehose Nozzle for PCF has been developed as a Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime application.
The Nozzle subscribes to the Cloud Foundry Loggregator endpoint and writes events to an external Splunk environment.

* A Golang routine collects events from the PCF Loggregator endpoint.
* An in-memory queue buffers events for availability to multiple Splunk HTTP Event Collector clients.
* The Splunk HTTP Event Collector clients run with their own Golang routines that consumes events from the queue to enrich PCF events by attaching
metadata fields.
* Finally, the events are batched together and sent to Splunk via the HEC Endpoint.
