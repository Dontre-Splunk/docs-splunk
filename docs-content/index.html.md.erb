This documentation describes the Splunk Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Firehose. The Splunk Nozzle integrates with PCF [Loggregator](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/loggregator/index.html) and forwards to Splunk Enterprise streaming logs & metrics from all of the user applications and system components of Cloud Foundry. PCF operators can then gain operational visibility over their PCF infrastructure including the health and performance of applications & system components.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

After [installing](/installing.html) the Splunk Nozzle for PCF Firehose tile, PCF streaming logs & metrics will be forwarded to user-specified Splunk Enterprise target server(s) configured to receive data. PCF operators & Splunk users can then immediately search & analyze PCF Firehose data from their Splunk Enterprise deployment, and easily build reports, dashboards, and alerts on the health of their foundation and the performance of the applications.

Splunk Nozzle for PCF Firehose includes the following key features:

* Simple setup with out of the box data parsing & enrichment for various PCF event types
* Reliable event delivery by leveraging Splunk Forwarder capabilities from indexer acknowledgement, buffering and load balancing.
